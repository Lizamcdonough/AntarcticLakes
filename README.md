Baseline dataset for sub-aerial Antarctic lake water chemistry and Python code

File "Baseline dataset.zip" contains a compilation of Antarctic sub-aerial lake and pond water data. Lakes are categorised as Saline or Freshwater (Saline_freshwater column) per publication "Climate change impacts on sub-aerial Antarctic lakes: A review of processes driving water chemistry and projected future changes" by Liza K. McDonough, Karina T. Meredith, Jon Hawkings, John Gibson, Narelle Hegarty, William Berry Lyons and Krystyna M. Saunders.

File "Python code.zip" contains the Python code used to generate figures 3, 4 and 5 in the above publication. Sampling depth ("Depth") is presented in meters below surface. Conductivity is presented as ÂµS/cm. Na, K, Mg, Ca, Cl, Si, SO4, NO2, NO3, PO4 and DOC are presented as mg/L. Na_Cl, SO4_Cl, Mg_Cl and Ca_Cl represent ratios of the elements.
